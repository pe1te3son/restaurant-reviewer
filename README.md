# Restaurant-reviewer

Developed a restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility. Remotely accessing JSON data from Foursquare API and reloading with new data if a filter is applied. The user can search for restaurants by selecting a location with help of Google's autocomplete API. Each restaurant displays information and currently submitted reviews.
